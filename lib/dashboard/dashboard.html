                <h3>Servers</h3>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>On Windows I can create servers using ports 80 and 443, but it keeps resulting in an error on Linux.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Linux, by policy, restricts normal users from running services on ports below 1025.
                        This can be circumvented by running this application with elevated privilege, as an OS service, or using the package <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/libcap/">libcap</a>.
                        My preference is to run the application as an OS service using systemd.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>I created a redirect_asset rule for an absolute path, but it doesn't work.</h4>
                    <p>
                        For security reasons server paths are absolute to the server's asset location on the machine file system and not the root of the file system.
                        If redirection should occur for assets outside the server's asset tree I recommend creating a symbolic link in the server's asset location.
                        In Linux this is accomplished with <code>ln -s /desired/path link_name</code> where the first path is where the files actually are and the second is where the link will be in the file system.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>I am trying to redirect traffic to a vanity domain from one server spawned by this application to another server spawned by this application, but it isn't working.</h4>
                    <p>
                        The destination server must have the vanity domain listed in its <em>domain_local</em> list.
                        For increased security servers will only accept connections to known addresses, which includes IP address and wildcards already supported on local machine interfaces.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>How can I ensure an end-to-end encrypted tunnel between my users and a proxied destination?</h4>
                    <p>
                        First, verify the given server is set to <em>encryption</em> values <strong>both</strong> or <strong>secure</strong>.
                        If the given server does not have a secure TLS instance running it will not be able to proxy to an encrypted TLS destination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, ensure there is a <em>redirect_domain</em> entry for the given server named with a <strong>.secure</strong> suffix, such as mybank.com.secure as opposed to just mybank.com.
                        That tells this application to only proxy via TLS on incoming TLS connections.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>On a server entry I specified a <em>redirect_domain</em> entry using <strong>.secure</strong> as a naming suffix to create an end-to-end encrypted connection, but it does not work.</h4>
                    <p>
                        First, verify the given server is set to <em>encryption</em> values <strong>both</strong> or <strong>secure</strong>.
                        If the given server does not have a secure TLS instance running it will not be able to proxy to an encrypted TLS destination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, verify the destination is working without using a proxy connection by directly going to the destination address and port in a web browser.
                        If the destination fails via direct request then a proxy connection will also expect to fail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third, if the destination is failing through direct encrypted access via HTTPS but still works through unencrypted HTTP access you can fall back to partial encryption by deleting the <em>redirect_domain</em> entry with the <strong>.secure</strong> suffix.
                        Partial encryption still encrypts data between the proxy, your server running from this application, and the users.
                        Partial encryption will not encrypt data between the proxy and the destination.
                        Typically partical encryption is good enough for privacy, but should not be trusted with sensitive data like passwords or connections to financial institutions.

                <h3>Containers</h3>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>None of the Docker commands seem to work, as though they aren't even there. I verified Docker and Docker Compose are installed.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most of the docker commands require elevated privilege to run and otherwise pretend to not exist.
                        Docker does provide a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/">guide</a> to run docker commands as a regular user on Linux, but it seems many people (myself included) cannot get this to work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For security reasons I strongly recommend not executing docker commands directly with sudo unless you have no other choice.
                        Instead I recommend running docker commands via some interface that is already running as a service.
                        My personal solution is to run this application via systemd on Linux and then run Docker command via the terminal provided by the browser dashboard.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>I added a new Docker Container but it's showing offline. I also ran <em>docker ps</em> in the terminal and the new container is not in the list.</h4>
                    <p>Because the Docker Daemon is a service unrelated to this application containers require a separate activation step.</p>
                    <p>
                        After the new container is submitted click on the new container that now displays in the container list.
                        Once expanded there will exist an Edit button under the Docker Compose text area.
                        Click the Edit button and then click the <em>Activate</em> button that appears.
                        This button will run the equivalent of Docker's <strong>up</strong> command and dump the output to the terminal.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Docker wrote files as user root and now I cannot open them.</h4>
                    <p>
                        This happens because by default Docker executes with elevated privilege.
                        It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended to specify in each Docker Compose file environmental properties PUID and PGID with values of 1000.
                        This allows the container to execute as the OS's default user without elevated privilege access.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>On regular intervals my container appears to flicker between up and down.  Upon further investigation I found the container issues 3 events: <em>exec-create</em>, <em>exec-start</em>, <em>exec-die</em>.</h4>
                    <p>This is how containers execute healthchecks. To stop a service from issuing a health check add the following property to the concerned service in the respective Docker Compose file: <code>
    healthcheck:
      disable: true
                    </code></p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>Docker isn't working after computer restart.</h4>
                    <p>See if the problem is solved by restarting service <em>containerd</em> first and then service <em>docker</em> second. Then review service logs to determine if service <em>docker</em> started without error.</p>

                        This application requires installation of NMap to scan the machine for open ports.

                <div class="section">
                    <h4>General</h4>
                    <p>From the command line build the application code with <code>npm run build</code> and execute the application with <code>npm run server</code></p>
                    <p>By default the application assigns random ports for the dashboard. I recommend changing these to a port of your preference, such as 3000.  Then the dashboard can be accessed by http://localhost:3000.</p>
                    <p>If extending the application code checks can be performed using <code>npm run tsc</code> and <code>npm run lint</code></p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>Register the application as a POSIX service</h4>
                    <p>First, create a service file for <em>systemd</em> to consume at location: <strong>/etc/systemd/system/&lt;service name here&gt;.service</strong></p>
                    <p>My service file looks like:
<code>[Unit]
Description=Node Web Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/home/cheney/.nvm/versions/node/v23.1.0/bin/node /home/cheney/webserver/js/lib/index.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
WorkingDirectory=/home/cheney/webserver

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></p>
                    <p>Finally, register and start your service with the following commands:
<code>sudo systemctl start &lt;service name here&gt;
sudo systemctl enable &lt;service name here&gt;
sudo systemctl status &lt;service name here&gt;
</code> The <em>enable</em> command tells systemd to execute this service on OS boot. The <em>status</em> command prints output to screen indicating status health to confirm the service is executing as a service.</p>
                    <p>To inspect output written to the shell by the application use this command: <code>sudo journalctl -u &lt;service name here&gt; --since "2 minutes ago".</code></p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>Servers</h4>
                    <h5>Proxies</h5>
                    <p>The servers feature fully capable, though optional, support for proxies. The proxy support is divided between redirection to resources outside the given server and resources within the given server.  See the 'Definitions of Server Object Properties' on the Servers tab for more information.</p>
                    <p>The servers also feature full support for WebSockets and partial support for HTTP.  HTTP is served over WebSockets which allows both protocols to coexist on the same port. All HTTP and WebSocket traffic receives full and equivalent proxy support.</p>
                    <h5>HTTP Methods</h5>
                    <p>HTTP methods <em>DELETE</em>, <em>POST</em>, and <em>PUT</em> are supported by this application but are not handled by this application. If these HTTP methods are to be used a given server must specify a file system path to corresponding libraries executed as child processes. Simply populate the respective properties on a new server's configuration object.</p>
                    <h5>Custom WebSocket Message Handling</h5>
                    <p>Custom WebSocket messaging handling is supported by supplying a custom function to library <em>/lib/transmit/messageHandler.ts</em>. Simply add a new property to the library object where the key name is the same as the name of the respective server and then rebuild the application.  For example:
<code>const message_handler:transmit_socket_messageHandler = {
    default: function transmit_messageHandler(bufferData:Buffer):void {
        // default message handling
    },
    "my_server_name": function (data:Buffer) {
        // custom message handling
    }
}</code></p>
                    <h5>Deletion</h5>
                    <p>Deleting a server will remove the associate file system tree. <strong>Back up files you may wish to preserver before deleting a server.</strong></p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>Logs</h4>
                    <p>Logging is fully customizable.  Simply call the <em>lib/utilities/log.ts</em> passing an object matching interface <em>config_log</em>. The front-end currently does not display configuration details and error objects, but that support is there awaiting display support from the front-end.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h4>Terminal</h4>
                    <p>The terminal makes use of NPM modules <em>@xterm/xterm</em> and <em>@lydell/node-pty</em>. These packages expose a shell to the browser front-end with full support for SSH, VIM, IRSSI, and more. The default supported shells are PowerShell in Windows and /bin/sh elsewhere. To customize that to a different shell, such as Bash, simply modify the appropriate one line of code at <em>/lib/services/terminal.ts</em> and then rebuild the application.</p>
                    <p>Please see this guide for <a href="https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797">ANSI Escape Codes</a> to extend and modify output to the terminal.</p>

                <h3>HTTP Format <button class="expand" data-tag="div">Expand</button></h3>
                <div class="definitions">
                    <p>HTTP is a text-based application layer transmission protocol defined as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>.</p>
                    <p>The first line of an HTTP request a space separated list of method, resource path (also known as <em>end point</em>), and protocol.
                        Each following line is separated by a CRLF (x0Dx0A) sequence. This application handles that formatting for you.
                        The header portion of the request is separated from a body portion by an empty line, which is two or more consecutive sequences of CRLF.
                        A body portion is optional and only used by certain HTTP methods. All lines after the first and before the body portion are headers.
                        Each header gets its own line and is a case-insensitive name followed by a colon, zero or more spaces, and a text value.</p>
                    <p>A <em>host</em> header is required and is generally the second line of the raw request string.
                        The host value is taken from the domain portion of a web address.
                        The domain portion of an address includes authentication, domain name, and port.
                        The authentication portion is optional and rarely used.</p>
                    <p>The port portion of a domain is optional and rarely included if connecting with plain text HTTP over port 80 or encrypted HTTPS over port 443.
                        In all other cases the port number is a colon separated suffix to the domain name.
                        In the case of an IPv6 address the domain name must be inclosed in sqaure braces before specifying the port number, example: <strong>host: [2600:1700:1234:5678::a]:8081</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The method is one of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">HTTP request methods</a>. <strong>GET</strong> is the most common.</li>
                        <li>The end point looks like a Unix absolute file path always starting with a forward slash.</li>
                        <li>The protocol is HTTP, forward slash, and a version number, such as <em>HTTP/1.1</em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An HTTP request can be either plain text or a TLS encryption. That distinction is not provided in the HTTP header but is inferred by context.</p>
                    <p>The default behavior of HTTP version 1.1 is to keep a socket open for multiple sequential request/response round trips. HTTP 1.0 does not have this capability, called <em>keep-alive</em>, and it forbidden in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.  As a result, in HTTP/1.1, we must have an indicator different than socket termination to determine when a response completes. This following list determines response message completion.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The socket closes.</li>
                        <li>The response header is completed with the <em>"\r\n\r\n</em> empty line sequence and the response contains no body portion.</li>
                        <li>The response header contains a heading <em>transfer-encoding: chunked</em> and the body terminates with a message chunk containing exactly <em>0\r\n\r\n</em>.</li>
                        <li>The response header contains a heading <em>content-length</em> with a numeric value and the byte length, not character length, of the body portion only equals that header value.</li>
                    </ul>

                        Redirects resource paths of HTTP requests within the given server based upon the hostname in the HTTP request header.
                        This is useful for dynamic or vanity endpoints on a given server that wish to return something different than a relative file system destination.
                        Each instance uses the structure of <code>"domain": {"resource location": "new location"}</code> because each server can represent 0 or more domain names.
                    </p><p>
                        For example there could be an informational dashboard on some server at address: <em>http://myexample.com/api_services/informational/dashboards/uptime/</em>.
                        For the sake of simplicity you want to serve that dashboard from an internal vanity domain like: <em>http://api.dashboard/</em>.
                        You would need a rule to redirect from resource <em>/</em> to actual resource at <em>/api_services/informational/dashboards/uptime</em>, and that rule would look like: <code>"api.dashboard": {"/": "/api_services/informational/dashboards/uptime/"}</code>
                    </p><p>
                        Asset redirection supports use of wildcards by specifying an asterisk at the end of asset locations.
                        For example, redirection of request for <em>/api_services/informational/dashboards/uptime/images/interface/title.png</em> to <em>/api/images/interface/title.png</em> would occur with rule: <code>"api.dashboard": {"/api/*": "/api_services/informational/dashboards/uptime/"}</code>
                        With wildcards all asset requests matching the address up to the asterisk will be redirected to the specified location.
                    </p><p>
                        <strong>Please note the terminal slash in the prior examples.</strong>
                        Without the terminating slash the redirected address becomes <em>/api_services/informational/dashboards/uptimeimages/interface/title.png</em>.
                    </p></dd>
                    <dt><em>redirect_domain</em> (object)</dt>
                    <dd><p>
                        Redirects traffic to a different server location, such as a vanity domain that may or may not be served from the same server.
                        Each instance uses the structure of <code>"domain": ["new domain", port_number]</code> because each server can represent 0 or more domain names.
                        If the 'new domain' is an empty string the requested domain will be used.
                        If the port number is not a number or 0 the current server's port number will be used.
                    </p><p>
                        If TLS connections needs to be directed to a port different than open connections then use the naming convnetion <strong>myDomain.secure</strong>, for example: <code>"jellyfin.x.secure": ["", 3003]</code>
                    </p></dd>
                    <dt><em>temporary</em> (boolean)</dt>
                    <dd><p>
                        Providing property <em>temporary</em> with value <em>true</em> will create a server that only accepts a first successful HTTP or WebSocket connection.
                        All other connections will be ignored and the server will automatically remove itself once that connection completes.
